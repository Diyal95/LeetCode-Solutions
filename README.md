# LeetCode Solutions

## Why I Started Practicing DSA

I started practicing Data Structures and Algorithms to strengthen my core programming skills. Coming from a non-CS background, I realized how important DSA is—not just for coding interviews, but also for areas I’m actively exploring, like:

<details>
  <summary><strong>Fields where DSA helps me:</strong></summary>

  <br/>

  - **Backend Development**  
    Helps structure logic, optimize performance, and build scalable systems.

  - **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**  
    Supports efficient model design and algorithmic thinking.

  - **Machine Learning**  
    Improves data handling, model optimization, and pipeline design.

  - **IoT Systems**  
    Helps manage real-time data, memory constraints, and device communication.

  - **OpenCV and Computer Vision**  
    Useful for image matrix operations, graph-based analysis, and performance tuning.

A good grasp of DSA helps me write efficient and structured code, which is essential when working with data-heavy applications, model pipelines, and system-level logic.

## About This Repo

This repository contains my personal LeetCode solutions, written in **Python** and **C++**. I'm gradually organizing them by topic and difficulty to keep track of my learning and progress over time.
