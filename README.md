  <summary><strong>How DSA Helps in My Learning Journey</strong></summary>

  <br/>

  - <strong>Backend Development:</strong>  
    DSA improves how I structure logic, handle large datasets, and build scalable, efficient systems (e.g., queues, caching, load balancing, etc.).

  <br/>

  - <strong>Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning:</strong>  
    Algorithms and data structures are foundational for implementing model logic, managing data flow, and optimizing training performance (e.g., trees in decision trees, heaps in priority queues, graphs in neural nets).

  <br/>

  - <strong>Data Analytics:</strong>  
    Efficient data processing and manipulation often relies on core DSA concepts like hash maps, sorting, and searching algorithms.

  <br/>

  - <strong>IoT Systems:</strong>  
    Many IoT applications require optimized memory and real-time data handling—DSA helps manage sensor data, queues, and system logic efficiently.

  <br/>

  - <strong>OpenCV & Computer Vision:</strong>  
    Image processing benefits from graph traversal, matrix manipulation, and optimized data handling—all rooted in DSA.
